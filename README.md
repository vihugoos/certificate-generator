Two AWS Lambda functions for generating and verifying a course certificate (Serverless with Node.js). The <b>generateCertificate</b> function is responsible for receiving the data, generating a certificate, storing it in Amazon S3 and returning the pdf link in the request response. The <b>verifyCertificate</b> function receives the user ID to verify if the certificate is valid, if valid, it returns the pdf link.
